# Rust Course Project

This repository contains code and exercises from a Rust programming course. The goal is to learn core Rust concepts by building and exploring small, practical examples.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- 🦀 Rust syntax & variables
- 🔁 Control flow (if, match, loops)
- 📦 Cargo & project structure
- 📚 Ownership, borrowing, lifetimes
- 🧱 Structs, Enums, Traits
- 🧵 Error handling
- 🔧 Modules & Crates

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install Rust (if you haven't):
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
````

2. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rust-course-project.git
   cd rust-course-project
   ```

3. Build and run:

   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

## 📁 Structure

* `src/main.rs` – Entry point of the project
* `src/lib.rs` – Shared library code (if used)
* `src/modules/` – Extra modules and examples (optional)
* `Cargo.toml` – Project manifest

## 📝 Notes

This project is structured for learning purposes. Each module or example demonstrates a specific Rust feature.
